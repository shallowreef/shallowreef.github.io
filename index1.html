		Our tees are printed with water based inks, which is safer for the environment and softer to the touch than standard plastisol inks. <br>It also means that the more you wear your shirt, the softer it will feel, <br>and more vintage it will look.

		Our goal is to make things we actually want to wear: simple designs that complement our surfy, island lifestyle in a creative way. The Shallow Reef Studio is for the people who can't get out of the water, always need to catch one more wave, crave open air, and live for the next adventure.
